# Model Transpiler TP7

## Supported Models

This tool supports the following machine learning models:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Binary Sizes

The generated binary files for the models are as follows:

- **Decision Tree Model**: 16K
- **Linear Model**: 16K
- **Logistic Model**: 16K

## Usage

### Requirements

To use the tool, you need a `.joblib` file for the model. The `.joblib` file should be located in the root directory of the project.

### Creating a `.joblib` File

You can either use a pre-existing `.joblib` file or create one using the training scripts provided in the repository.

To create a `.joblib` file, run the relevant training script:

- **Train Decision Tree**: `train_decision_tree.py`
- **Train Linear Regression**: `train_linear_regression.py`
- **Train Logistic Regression**: `train_logistic_regression.py`

These scripts will generate `.joblib` files that can be used with the transpiler.

### Running the Transpiler

Once you have your `.joblib` file, you can run the model transpiler with the following command:

```bash
python transpile_model.py <joblib_file>
```

The script will detect the type of model based on the `.joblib` file and generate the corresponding binary for the model.

### Changing Predictions

If you need to modify the prediction logic or features, you will need to edit the relevant transpile file corresponding to the model type:

- For **Decision Tree**, modify the `transpile_decision_tree.py` file.
- For **Linear Regression**, modify the `transpile_linear_regression.py` file.
- For **Logistic Regression**, modify the `transpile_logistic_regression.py` file.

In these files, you can adjust the features or the logic for how predictions are made.

### Testing the Predictions

Each model includes a `predict` file that can be used to test whether the predictions are correct based on the input features.

To test the predictions, call the `predict` file with the appropriate input and verify the output.

## Notes

- The generated binaries are small (16K each), making them efficient to deploy.
- The script automatically recognizes the type of model in the `.joblib` file and handles the transpilation accordingly.
- If you need to adjust the prediction logic, itâ€™s straightforward to modify the corresponding transpile function.

Feel free to modify the transpiler to support additional model types or customize the existing ones!
